# Sample Suitescript File Uploader

This example is ready to rock with suitecloud ide. It assumes you have the node ide installed
and are creating an account customization project.

## Commands

I included an updated package.json that I use to speed things up. Try it if you dont already
have something you go to. 

#### Deploy Only

Running this command will deploy the project.

```javascript
npm run deploy
```
#### Update (Interactive Mode)

Running this command will send you into the update interactive mode.

```javascript
npm run update
```
#### Build/Validate/Deploy

Running this command will add dependencies, validate, and deploy your customization.

```javascript

```
